# 📰 Newsify Detector – AI-Powered Fake News Verification

**Newsify Detector** is an AI-powered fake news verification system designed to determine whether a given news statement is **Real ✅ or Fake ❌** using modern **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and a hybrid verification approach.

This project was developed as an academic initiative to explore **LLM reasoning, explainable AI, backend development, and secure data storage** in a real-world application.

## 🚀 Project Overview
The system accepts news input in both **text and voice format**, analyzes the content using **Google Gemini (LLM)**, and generates a detailed verification response.  
Instead of only giving a binary result, the system provides **explainable insights** such as reasoning, confidence level, and sources, making the output more transparent and user-friendly.

## 🔍 Key Features
- 📝 Accepts **text-based news input**
- 🎙️ Supports **voice-based news input**
- 🧠 Uses **Google Gemini (LLM)** for real-time fact verification
- 📊 Generates **verdict, explanation, confidence score, and sources**
- 🔊 Converts results into **speech output** for better accessibility
- 🗄️ Securely stores all verification records in a **MySQL database**

---

## 🔁 Hybrid Verification Approach
The system follows a **hybrid verification design**:
- **LLM-based reasoning** acts as the core decision engine
- Architecture is **future-ready** to integrate trusted news APIs and external sources for cross-verification and enhanced reliability

This design improves flexibility and scalability while maintaining explainability.
